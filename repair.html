                            Gone are the days of packing up your computer or laptop and driving to your local computer repair store.
                             We know you don’t 
                            have time to waste and need your computer fixed now not later.
                             The best thing about us is your computer is fixed within a few hours and you are back to your day. We focuses on a true convenience and what our customer’s love. Best of all, we are not here to sell you something you don’t want like software or some long term contract. If we can’t fix your computer we will give you some advice and wish you the best. No charge.

                                That’s right. We have a very simple pricing model. Which means there are no surprise charges on your credit card.
                                 No weird setup fees, no monthly fees, no “It’s Wednesday, so we need to charge you double fees”. 
                                 All our charges are one time only and we have a max fee of P999 so we will not charge you more than that regardless of how long we work on your computer. Finally, there are no forms or user accounts to sign up for. The last thing you need is one more username and password to keep track of.

                                We use Paypal for our credit card processing which means we don’t store your payment information anywhere on our systems. 
                                We collect your credit card at the end of our session, or you can use our secure shopping cart, and once your transaction is complete we can NEVER look up your credit card at a later time. 
                                To take this even further, if you don’t feel comfortable reading your credit card to our technician you can enter it yourself on our shopping cart page so we never see the information

                                    Yes you read that correctly. We do NOT charge you until our work is complete.
                                     So you must be satisfied that we have fixed your computer before we collect payment information from you. 
                                     Our competitors always collect their money up front before they start working. 
                                     This makes no sense to us. If you go to a restaurant does the waiter ask you to pay before your food arrives? Of course not.
                                      You need to make sure the food is to your liking and that you had and overall good experience.
                                       We believe the same concept applies here at Azure Development Team.

                                    Yes we have a 100% money back guarantee. 
                                    So if we charge you and several days later you feel your computer is not working properly 
                                    then we can take another look or you can simply ask us for a refund.
                                     You will not have to try to chase us down, or fill out some complex form for your refund. 
                                     If you are not happy then we simply refund your money. 
                                     No questions asked. To put this in perspective, we only process a handful of refunds per year. 
                                     This is a rare occurrence, but rest assured, we want to make sure you are happy.
